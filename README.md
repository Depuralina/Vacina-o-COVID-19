# <a name="_toc8179"></a>Introduction 
As part of the Programming Paradigms course, I was asked to create a computer application to manage the COVID-19 vaccination process.

To carry out this work, I applied what I had learned during the semester and also used the resources provided by the teachers as well as API and Google documentation.

This project consists of two parts: Backend and Frontend, which can be found in another folder in this file.
